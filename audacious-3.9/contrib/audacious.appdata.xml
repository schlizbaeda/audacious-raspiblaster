    <p>
      Audacious is an open source audio player. Originally a descendant of XMMS,
      Audacious plays your music how you want it, without stealing away your
      computer’s resources from other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag and drop folders and individual song files, search for artists and
      albums in your entire music library, or create and edit your own custom
      playlists. Listen to CD’s or stream music from the Internet. Tweak the
      sound with the graphical equalizer or experiment with LADSPA
      effects. Enjoy the modern GTK-themed interface or change things up with
      Winamp Classic skins. Use the plugins included with Audacious to fetch
      lyrics for your music, to set an alarm in the morning, and more.
